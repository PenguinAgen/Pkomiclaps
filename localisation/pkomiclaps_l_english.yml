 pkomiclaps_republic:0 "Pkomiclaps Republic"
 pkomiclaps_republic_desc:0 "The Pkomiclaps ideology is an intelligent combination of some other ideologies, and the name reflects this. The silent, yet pronounced 'p' at the beginning of the word stands for the plutocratic part of pkomiclaps. 'kom' is short for communism, and 'i' stands for imperialism. The next part is a bit more complicated. The 'clap' is a short version of the combination of capatalism and liberalism called clapatalism. The final letter 's' signifies socialism."

We've also started calling them Gustav, which helps a lot too."
