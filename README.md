First a word of warning: this is my first ever git hub repo, so be prepared for some serious suboptimality.

* Other stuff I've forgotten about!

## Usage

The descriptor calls this mod "Pkomiclaps Dev". That's because I clone it into mod/Pkomiclaps Dev so I can have a seperate directory for a working pkomiclaps.
