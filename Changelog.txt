   -Running fast in Congo
   -Pirates in Somalia area

2.0.2 (5 Jun 2017 @ 5:57pm):
 -Bug fixes
  -Tried to fix the absorption bugs created by the last update. However, any_neighbor_province doesn't seem to be working, so colonizable land counts as wasteland. Not ideal and leads to some seriously easy stuff in the New World and Africa.
2.0.3 (15 Jun 2017 @ 6:31pm):
 -Changed some localisation, including making some events say which country they come from instead of saying "Another country".
 -Removed pkomiclaps rebels. They weren't used but still popped up.
 -Updated the Pkomiclaps ideas to better fit the new updates. They should also be slightly less over-powered.
 -Updated to patch 1.22
2.1.0 (21 Jun @ 8:54pm):
-Updated to patch 1.25
-Removed custom pkomiclaps missions. Pkomiclaps now inherits missions from whichever country it is formed from.
-Other stuff I can't remember.
2.1.1 (22 Jun @ 11:04am):
-Removed the unfinished estates that didn't work anyway.

Planned:
 -More conquest events
  -Europe
   -Stealing Italians
 -Event pictures. They wouldn't fit in with the current ones, but could be fun.
 -Fix absorption so colonizable land doesn't count as wasteland.
